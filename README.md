# HTK-Toolkit-in-Vietnamese
A very simple script using HTK Toolkit of the Cambridge University Engineering Department in recognise Vietnamese speech of VIVOS Corpus datasets

> The Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) is a portable toolkit for building and manipulating hidden Markov models. HTK is primarily used for speech recognition research although it has been used for numerous other applications including research into speech synthesis, character recognition and DNA sequencing. HTK is in use at hundreds of sites worldwide.
